# ASSESSING AIRLINES USING TABLEAU

## I. OBJECTIVE:

- **Motivation**: The airline business is defined by its operations' complexity. There are various factors that influence the overall performance of an airline. With the help of this project, we are going to perform various observations and come up with conclusions for the same.

- **Scope**: We are going to evaluate our airlines based on a number of criteria such as the competitors in the market, arrival and delay summary, cancellation frequencies, flight statistics such as average flight time and route information, and many other factors as we move forward working towards the project.

## II. VARIABLE SELECTION:

## III. COLLABORATION PLAN:

- The goal is for everyone to collaborate horizontally so that they may all contribute to the project at every step.
- We will collect data over time once the KPIs factors are found.
- Visualizations of metrics to analyze Envoy Airlines' and its competitors' on-time performance.
- We'll utilize Python programming language for exploratory data analysis.
- We will use Microsoft Excel, Tableau, and its filtering tools for data visualization.
